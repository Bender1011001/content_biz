# Changes Made to Fix Content Biz Application

## 1. Fixed CrewAI Import Issue

The application was failing to start due to an import error in `app/services/crewai_service.py`:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'Tool' from 'crewai'
```

This was caused by a change in the CrewAI API in version 0.108.0, which moved from a class-based approach to a decorator-based approach for defining tools.

### Solution:
- Changed the import from `from crewai import Tool` to `from crewai.tools import tool`
- Refactored the tool creation code to use the decorator pattern:
  ```python
  @tool("GetBriefData")
  def brief_data_tool(brief_id: str):
      """Fetch and validate the client brief data using the provided brief ID."""
      return get_brief_data(brief_id)
  ```
  Instead of the previous class instantiation pattern:
  ```python
  brief_data_tool = Tool(
      name="GetBriefData",
      description="Fetch and validate the client brief data using the provided brief ID.",
      func=get_brief_data
  )
  ```

## 2. Updated Replit Configuration

Updated the `.replit` file to ensure proper dependency installation:

```
args = "python -m pip install --break-system-packages --no-cache-dir openai>=1.61.0 && python -m pip install --break-system-packages --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt && python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm && alembic upgrade head && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000"
```

Key changes:
- Added explicit installation of `openai>=1.61.0` before other dependencies
- Used `--break-system-packages` flag to handle potential system package conflicts
- Kept the `--no-cache-dir` flag to avoid using cached packages that might cause conflicts

## 3. Created Documentation

Created two new documentation files:

### 3.1 Replit Setup Instructions
Created `replit_setup_instructions.md` with detailed instructions for:
- Initial setup
- Configuring secrets
- Configuring the Replit environment
- Database setup
- Testing the application
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Production considerations

### 3.2 Replit Assistant Prompt
Created `replit_assistant_prompt.md` with a prompt for the Replit AI assistant to:
- Verify dependencies
- Configure the `.replit` file
- Ensure the application runs
- Verify basic functionality
- Check secret usage

## 4. Next Steps

The application should now be ready to run on Replit. The next steps are:

1. Push these changes to the GitHub repository
2. Pull the changes into the Replit environment
3. Run the application on Replit
4. Verify that the application starts without errors
5. Test the complete workflow:
   - Submit a brief through the form
   - Make a test payment
   - Verify the CrewAI workflow executes
   - Check that the email is sent
