# Prompt for Replit AI Assistant

**Project:** content_biz
**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, Uvicorn, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, CrewAI, Spacy, Pydantic, Stripe, SMTP/SendGrid

**Goal:** Get this FastAPI application running successfully on Replit, ready for end-to-end testing and eventual production deployment.

**Current Status:**
* Code is imported from the GitHub repository (Bender1011001/content_biz).
* Required environment variables (Secrets) have been added, including connection details for a Replit-hosted PostgreSQL database (`DATABASE_URL`).
* The application was previously failing to start due to dependency conflicts and import errors.
* The code has been updated to use the decorator pattern for CrewAI tools: `from crewai.tools import tool` instead of `from crewai import Tool`.

**Task for Replit Assistant:**
1. **Verify Dependencies:** Ensure `requirements.txt` defines a compatible set of versions for all packages, especially `fastapi`, `crewai`, `spacy`, and `pydantic`. Prioritize getting a working combination, preferably using Pydantic v2 if possible, as required by `crewai`.

2. **Configure `.replit` File:** Check the `run` command in the `.replit` file. It should be:
   ```
   run = "python -m pip install --break-system-packages --no-cache-dir openai>=1.61.0 && python -m pip install --break-system-packages --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt && python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm && alembic upgrade head && uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000"
   ```

3. **Ensure Application Runs:** Fix any issues preventing the Uvicorn server from starting successfully.

4. **Verify Basic Functionality:** Confirm that the application runs, the root URL (`/`) loads the submission form, and there are no immediate connection errors to the Replit PostgreSQL database upon startup.

5. **Check Secret Usage:** Briefly verify that the application seems configured to read secrets correctly (e.g., no obvious errors related to missing API keys during startup, though full functionality requires testing).

**Desired Outcome:**
The application should be running stably on Replit, accessible via its public URL, and ready for end-to-end testing (submitting the form, making a test payment, checking email). Please summarize the fixes applied.

*(Note: Stripe keys are currently test keys, and email uses SMTP via Gmail App Password. These will be updated later for full production.)*
